# BoardingPass
Web application for rapidly checking student ID numbers against classroom rosters for admission to an event.

The purpose of this program is to provide a high-speed means of filtering and logging school
students as they enter (or exit) an area.

The impetus for this was an incentive activity provided during lunchtime at a middle school,
where a high-speed means was needed for confirming eligibility of students moving in line
through a doorway to attend the incentive. In such a case it was infeasible for any one adult
to know who should and who should not be admitted, nor was it feasible to check names against
a series of lists (rosters) with anything close to adequate speed.

This web applications allows one or a series of rosters to be pre-loaded and configured so
students have only to enter their ID numbers. The program checks valid numbers against the
rosters instantly and renders a verdict that is visible to the student and any staff members
standing nearby.

This program is delivered as a single flat file, as the target demographic of users is not
expected to be comfortable with web application deployment and maintenance. With a one-file
design, this file can be saved and executed anywhere under any name without affecting its
function.
